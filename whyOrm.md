When it comes to back-end development, working wth databases can become a hassle if you're not a master at the sql being used.
There are many database systems to choose from. The list includes:

> Mysql
> PostgresSQL
> MariaDB
> MongoDB
> Oracle

and many others. However, the database system being used depends entirely on the requirements of the project which may change with time.
The senarios where the DB system changes along with time can be a very complicated one if you need to change the entire database setup from the connection to the queries. Here is where ORM or Object-Relational-Mapping comes to the rescue. They actually make it easier to write code once you get the hang of them. Not just this, an Object-Relational-Mapping tool entirely takes away the pain (perceived) of writing SQL. As object-oriented programmers, we tend to think in terms of objects.
